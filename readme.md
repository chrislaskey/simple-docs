About
================================================================================

A documentation file viewer for Markdown files built on top of Flask.

Spending most of my time in tmux+vim, I write most of my sysadmin/dev-ops
documentation in text files using Markdown syntax.

This site is a presentation layer for these files, built in Flask. By pointing
to a directory of documentation files on a server, the markdown files are
rendered in a reader friendly manner for other technical and non-technical
staff to see.
