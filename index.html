				<h1>Setup</h1>
 				<p>Write plain-text documentation right from the command line.</p>
 				<p>No context switching to log into wiki's. No compilation to forget. No caches to clear.</p>
				<p>Setup requires Python 2.6+, a webserver, and creating a symlink.</p>


				<h1>Motivation</h1>

				<p>Ever have bits of information saved across your computer? A list of potential dog names, articles to read, or directions on how to set up a new webserver.</p>

				<p>I do. My computer is like a modern day office desk filled with various sticky notes scattered all over the place. But instead of actual sticky notes, I use text files. Lots of text files. So many I lose track of where they are!</p>

				<p>I wrote Simple Docs to get a better grip on this. Though the type of data I store in these files is very varied, the format is the same - it's all just text: headings, sentences, and paragraphs.</p>
				
				<p>Simple Docs gives me one central location to store this information and mirrors all these files on a website, in an easily readible format that's mobile friendly, searchable, and navigable.</p>

				<h2>Technical Details</h2>

				<p>When building the tool I kept this idea of simplicity going.</p>

				<p>Websites can do incredible things these days, which is great! But it also means sometimes these sites require a lot of knowledge specific to a particular website. How do I create a new user in WordPress again? Oh wait, who can see my Facebook posts?</p>

				<p>Most of the time this is easy to remember. But sometimes I forget. And every time I do I feel like I'm wasting time, or worse, I feel dumb.</p>

				<p>A lot of this complexity is reproducing functionality that already exists on computers. I'm a programmer by trade, so I know computers really well. I knew there's already user accounts, passwords, navigation tools, privacy controls, and search functionalities. What if instead of building all of these things again on the web, I built on top of what already exists, what I already know.</p>

				<p>Simple docs aims to do just that, make things simple. Easy to setup, with almost no upkeep required. Edit old documentation and write new ones with the same tools I do now. Built on well known tools so everything is easy to remember from searching, to navigating, to privacy controls.</p>

				<p>It helped me get a handle on those little, but often times important, pieces of information I kept letting fall through the cracks. Hope it can help you too!</p>
